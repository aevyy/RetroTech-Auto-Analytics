# 🚗 RetroTech Auto Analytics

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my RetroTech Auto Analytics project. I've built this super cool dashboard that mixes old-school retro vibes with modern car tech. Think synthwave aesthetics meet smart vehicle diagnostics!

## 🎮 What's This All About?

Ever wanted your car diagnostics to look like something out of an 80s sci-fi movie? Well, that's exactly what I built! This isn't your boring old OBD reader - it's a full-blown retro-futuristic experience that:

- Shows you real-time car stats with some sweet neon visualizations
- Uses AI to predict when your car needs some love
- Looks absolutely rad with a retro-synthwave UI
- Tracks everything from engine temp to performance metrics
- Makes car maintenance actually fun to look at

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

Here's what I used to build this bad boy:
- Python & Flask for the backend magic
- Some slick HTML5/CSS3/JS for the frontend
- NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for the smart stuff
- Plotly & Dash for those sweet, sweet visualizations
- Custom CSS that'll make you feel like you're in Tron
